# Welcome!

Maybe you've stumbled up on this website by mistake, maybe you have reached it via the power of the all mighty search engines, or maybe someone send you a link of this random kid beeing nerdy and writing down his thoughts, findings, and various other shinanigans.

My name is Stanislaw Przedzinkowski. I'm a 16 year old tech enthusiast. Mostly interested in Unix, Linux, hacking Apple hardware and retro tech.

I mess around with creating some music in my free time. I never released anything out to the public, but hopefully I'll be able to throw something that doesn't sound like it comes from a Chinese bootleg console together soon, and then we'll see.

If you have any questions, or just want to scream at me for my cringy writing of a newbie, feel free to shoot me an Email.
